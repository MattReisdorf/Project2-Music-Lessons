# Scaled

## Full stack web application where users can create and view their own musical scale lessons. Currently supports lessons of 7 or fewer notes. Future updates will include support for the full chromatic scale, ~~as well as the pitch detection model from the [ml5js](https://github.com/ml5js) team.~~

#### UPDATE: Now supports playing through individual notes of the lessons, thanks to Chris Wilson's [pitch detection algorithm](https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect). Works decently well with my guitar, but will pick up and possibly match with other sounds from the environment. For this reason, I would recommend practicing in a quiet space, or using an audio interface, if possible.
